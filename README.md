## Description

The Issue Duration Labeler action scans all issues in your repository (both open and closed) and adds a color-coded duration label to each. The duration is calculated as follows:
- For open issues: from creation date to current date
- For closed issues: from creation date to closed date

Labels are color-coded based on configurable thresholds:
- Short duration (default: â‰¤3 days): Green
- Medium duration (default: 4-10 days): Orange
- Long duration (default: >10 days): Red

This action can be run on a schedule or triggered manually, allowing you to keep your issues consistently labeled with up-to-date duration information.
